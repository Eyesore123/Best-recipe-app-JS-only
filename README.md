This project was my first bigger app project that I made from scratch, without instructions and I wrote it with JavaScript only. I used Firebase for backend. I was a fool and put all the JS in two separate files. One file contains over 500 lines of code. At the start of the project I had no clear idea about the proper file structure. I wasn't sure about how all the imports and exports worked so I did what I could.
