This project was my first bigger app project that I made, without instructions and I wrote it with JavaScript only. Firebase 12.0 was used for backend. I was a fool and put all the JS in two separate files. One file contains over 500 lines of code. At the start of the project I had no clear idea about the proper file structure. I wasn't sure about how all the imports and exports worked with ES6 modules so I did what I could. The app itself doesn't look that good, but I'm proud that I was able to put all the pieces together, and it works like a dream.
